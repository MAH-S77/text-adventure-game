## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### Option A: Run Front-End Only (No Database)
1. Download / clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

> Note: Login/registration may require the database + back-end configuration (see below).

### Option B: Run With Database (MySQL)
To use login and registration with database support, you will need:
- A MySQL server
- The provided database setup (schema/tables)
- The back-end / API files included in this repo (if applicable)

**General steps:**
1. Create a MySQL database
2. Import the SQL schema (if included)
3. Update database connection settings (host/user/password/db)
4. Start the server (if the project includes one)
5. Open the app in the browser

> If your repo contains a specific SQL file or server setup, document the exact steps here.
